# Relational-analysis-of-sales-data

We propose a pipeline for finding relationships between 
pre-determined categories in any relevant sales dataset or 
between multiple sales datasets having similar features in 
between themselves. The datasets must be cleaned and 
adequately pre-processed into a base form before being 
applied to the pipeline.

The code can work on two approaches i.e. single sales data
and multiple sales data. For better understanding refer to 
figures below explaining the two approaches.
